# cse571-racecars

## TODO:

- [x] **Post on Piazza:** Check what sensors the robots actually have! This will allow us to plan better and also remove some of the uncertainty from our project proposal. [Thomas]
- [x] Write prior work section of proposal summarizing prior work in this area. [Sort done - Ollin]
- [ ] Figure out how to get OpenCV (OpenCV4Tegra?) working, so that we can run all of the stuff that depends on opencv, like the camera and yolo itself. This may just mean undoing something that Ollin broke.
- [ ] Write YOLO-to-steering-controls node (basic version for now)
